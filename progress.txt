# Mocha Development Progress

## 2026-01-12 - setup-webui COMPLETED

### What was done:
- Downloaded WebUI library v2.5.0-beta.3 for macOS ARM64
- Created lib/ directory with webui.h, webui.hpp, and libwebui-2-static.a
- Created src/main.c with full implementation of all 3 bindings:
  - readFile(path, offset) - reads file with differential support for polling
  - getRecentFiles() - reads ~/.mocha/recent.json
  - addRecentFile(path) - adds to recent files list
- Created src/Makefile that compiles and links to WebUI static library
- Created dist/index.html test page for verifying bindings
- Successfully compiled mocha binary (264KB ARM64 executable)
- Verified with Playwright that:
  - Binary runs and opens browser window
  - getRecentFiles binding works (returns [])
  - readFile binding works (reads prd.json successfully)

### Files created:
- lib/webui.h, lib/webui.hpp, lib/libwebui-2-static.a
- src/main.c
- src/Makefile
- dist/index.html (test page)
- mocha (compiled binary)

### Notes for next developer:
- The C backend implementation is mostly complete, including JSON escaping
- Multi-client mode is enabled for testing (can be disabled in production)
- Next task should be setup-react to initialize the React/Vite/Tailwind frontend
- The dist/index.html is just a test page - will be replaced by React build output
- Build with: `cd src && make`
- Run with: `./mocha` from project root
